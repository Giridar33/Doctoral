The proposed solution is a comprehensive AI-powered platform designed to 
transform healthcare delivery by personalizing treatment for every patient. This 
platform will integrate data from various sources, such as genetic profiles, 
electronic health records (EHRs), and lifestyle patterns, to create detailed patient 
profiles. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, the platform will analyze 
these profiles to recommend precise treatments, including medications, therapy 
options, and preventive measures tailored to the individual’s needs. 


Key Features:
1.	Voice to text
2.	Multi-lingual support
3.	Disease Prediction
4.	Suggest the best medications, therapy plans, and preventive measures based on patient profiles.
5.	Recommends personalized drug dosages based on a patient’s genetic makeup.
6.	Generates a risk score to guide doctors on urgency levels.
7.	Provides evidence-based treatment suggestions with explainable AI (XAI).
